# Credit Risk Analysis

- Build and train classification and/or regression models from the dataset in any suitable programming environment of your choosing (e.g., MATLAB) using three machine learning techniques of your choice.

- Justify the rationale behind the choice of your dataset, machine learning techniques, and programming environment.

- Compare and contrast the performance of the three machine learning techniques in terms of prediction or validation accuracy, training time, prediction speed, R-squared values, MSE values, and transparency (as may be applicable).

- Analyse the error matrices, the ROCs (and AUCs) for all three methods (as may be applicable).

- Comment on how the hyperparameters (if any) are tuned or optimized (if applicable) to enhance the built/trained models.

- Submit a report showing the work carried out. Report like what u do after every module.
  
**Insightful approach to assist me while building my model**

- Is the data normally distributed or skewed?
- What's the gender characteristics?
- Does the Age good indicator to measure the Risk Level vs Credit amount?
- What's the correlation between the features of the dataframe?
